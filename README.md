# Photo-Editor

This project allows the user to upload photos and apply some processes to it. These processes include adding blur, changing color to gray, adding a border, resizing, and flipping. 
It uses an open-cv library to manipulate images, flask as the backend, and HTML and CSS for the frontend.
